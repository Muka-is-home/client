  founderText:
    "We're carrying on the legacy of the matriarch of our family who sowed a seed as an African-American realtor in the 1980's and 1990's. Muka is that seed fully bloomed.",
  founderPara1: "Buying and selling a home is not just a transaction—it’s one of the biggest milestones of your life, and I believe homeownership should be celebrated. It’s a symbol of achievement, security, and the foundation for building generational wealth. Sadly, the disparity in homeownership rates between minorities and their counterparts has persisted, with minorities at just a 41% homeownership rate. At MUKA, we aim to change that, offering you the tools and resources to take control of your journey toward homeownership.",
  founderPara2: "Our mission at MUKA goes beyond just providing access to realtors, experts, and home vendors—we are here to empower you. We want to make sure you have all the knowledge and support you need to make decisions that will set you up for success. Homeownership is a dream worth striving for, and with MUKA, we’re committed to helping you achieve it."
